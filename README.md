Tutorial Javascript Monad - Examples

Monads are a fundamental concept in functional programming, especially in languages ​​like Haskell, but they can also be used in JavaScript to handle operations like state manipulation, error handling, and asynchronous operations in a clean and compositional way. Let's approach the concept of monads in a practical and simple way.
What is a Monad?

A Monad is a structure that represents computations. For a framework to be a Monad, it must implement three main operations:

 unit (or return): Involves a value in a Monad.
 bind (or flatMap, or chain): Unfolds a value from a Monad, applies a function to it that returns a new Monad, and then flattens it.
